# IPL-data-analysis
This is an analysis of IPL data from 2008-19.

We are given the data of 11 years of IPL matches. In this rep, our main theme is to have a look at those factors which could possibly affect the winning of a particular team and try to get a correlation of those factors with the probability of victory.

For this, we have selected some factors which we thought would might essentially affect the chance of victory, they are as follows:

- Toss winning
- Extra runs given
- Effect of a particular playerâ€™s performance
- No.of Boundaries
- Average Run Rate
- Batting first

And we also thought that it would be good to analyse some trends in the data. Trends we analysed are as follows:

- Runs given by Pacers and spinners
- Wickets taken by Pacers and spinners
- Winning percentage based on extra runs given
- Inning wise winning percentage
